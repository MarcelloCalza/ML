# Project 2: Tree predictors for binary classification
Tree predictor + random forest for binary classification

# run.py 
Runs a demonstration that executes everything using the Mushroom dataset

# mushroom/tree.py
Contains the classes for the nodes (Node) and the tree predictors (DecisionTree)

# mushroom/forest.py
Contains the random forest class (RandomForest)

# mushroom/tuning.py
Contains the functions used for single level K-fold CV tuning for both the trees and the random forests.

# mushroom/diagnostics.py
Contains the functions used to execute empirical bias/variance analysis.

# mushroom/criteria.py
Contains just the impurity functions

# report/
Contains all the latex files of the report (and the report's pdf)

# data/
Contains some CSVs of the intermediate results of run.py that i saved

# plots/
Contains plots PNGs produced by run.py through the plotting function in diagnostics.py
